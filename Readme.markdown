# Pugs

Simple Swift app I wrote in two hours. You'd be surprized how quickly two hours passes.

## Building

Xcode 7 is required. There are no external dependencies.


## Features

* Gets pug photos from pugbomb API
* Tap to view
* Long-press to copy the URL


## Future Things

Given more time, these things would be nice:

* Caching
* Swipe left and right
* GIF support
* App icon
* Custom presentation controller for the modal
* Gesture to dismiss the image back into the grid
